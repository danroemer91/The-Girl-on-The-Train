<p> Emily Blunt gives an Oscar caliber performance in this riveting thriller, about a woman dealing with her addiction to alcohol, while also overcoming the fallout from her divorce. Emily Blunt plays Rachel and since her husband left her to be with another woman, she has continued to struggle with alcohol abuse. This addiction has made it increasingly more difficult for her to understand her own reality and the decisions she has made. Reminiscent in some senses of the Gillian Flynn novel Gone Girl, which inspired the almost equally as masterful David Fincher film of the same name, this is a twist-filled edge of your seat thriller. I loved this film. More to follow... </p>
